Merci
Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that he had slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory.
Or perhaps he had been ill? But the ceiling looked strange; it was flat, and it had dark beams richly carved.
He lay a little while longer looking at patches of sunlight on the wall, and listening to the sound of a waterfall.
`Where am I, and what is the time?' he said aloud to the ceiling.
'In the House of Elrond, and it is ten o'clock in the morning.' said a voice.
`It is the morning of October the twenty-fourth, if you want to know.'
`Gandalf!' cried Frodo, sitting up. There was the old wizard, sitting in a chair by the open window.
`Yes,' he said, `I am here. And you are lucky to be here, too, after all the absurd things you have done since you left home.' Frodo lay down again. He felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue, and in any case he did not think he would get the better of an argument. He was fully awake now, and the memory of his journey was returning: the disastrous `short cut' through the Old Forest the `accident' at The Prancing Pony; and his madness in putting on the Ring in the dell under Weathertop.
